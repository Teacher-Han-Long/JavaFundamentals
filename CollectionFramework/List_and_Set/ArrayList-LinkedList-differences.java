Differences Between LinkedList and ArrayList
-----------------------------------------------------------

Many similarities- homogeneous elements, insertion order preserved......

ArrayList() :
-best choice for retrieval operations
-worst choice for insertion and deletion in middle
-elements are stored in consecutive memory locations
	(resizable array - data structure)
LinkedList() :
-best choice for insertion and deletion in middle
-worst choice for retrieval operations
-elements not stored in consecutive memory locations (retrieval is complex) 
	(doublyLinkedList - data structure)
