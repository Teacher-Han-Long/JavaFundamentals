1. Why is SCP concept available to String Object and not StringBuffer?
	
	String is a regular customer. The most commonly used Object in Java.
	Special priviledges/memory management. May or my not use SB in an app.

2. Why is String immutable and StringBuffer is mutable?
	
	Because of SCP, immutability is required. Re-using of objects. 
	SCP concept does not exist in SBuffer class. Every time a new object is 
	always created. Changing an reference will not change an object. 
	
3. In addition to String, what other Objects are immutable in Java?
	
	ALL WRAPPER CLASS OBJECT, up to a certain range, objects will be re-used. 
	Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean
