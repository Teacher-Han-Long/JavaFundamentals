introduced in 1.0v			introduced in 1.5v


Buffer changed to Builder, synchronized removed.
Otherwise, cut and paste.

String
-----------------------------------
1. Content is fixed


StringBuffer
-----------------------------------
2. Content is not fixed
   Thread-safety is required

StringBuilder
-----------------------------------
3. Content is not fixed
   Thread-safety not desired

IS STRING THREAD SAFE?
-once we create a String Object, any changes performed on it
 will cause a new Object to be created.

ALL immutable objects in Java are thread-safe by default
(Wrapper classes, custom immutable objects)
