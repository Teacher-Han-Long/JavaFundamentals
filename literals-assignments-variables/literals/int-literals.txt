1. What is a primitive literal? Few examples: ?

2. 4 ways to represent integer numbers?

3. As of Java 7, numeric literals can be declared using what?

4. Where can you not use an underscore literal in:
integer
doubles or floats
hex
binary

4.5  We can use more than 1 underscore symbol between digits. T/F?

5. Binary literals can only use _ and _ and must start with __ or __.
example?

6. Octal integers use only digits _ to _.
How do you represent integers in Octal form in Java?
examples?
How many digits can you have in an octal number?

7. How is hex represented and why? Example?

8. All 4 integer literals are defined as ___ by default, but may also be 
specified as ____ by placing a suffix of __________after the number.
Example?

9. Valid or invalid?
int x = 0XBeer;
int x = 0XFace;
int x = 0777;
int x = 0xBeef;
int x = 0786;
int x = 10;

10. int x = 10
    int y = 010;
    int z = 0X10; What are the values?
 JVM will always display the values in what form?

11. Valid or invalid?
long l = 10L;
int x = 10L;
long l = 10;

12.
Is there a direct way to specify byte and short literals explicitly?
valid or invalid?
byte b = 128;
short s = 32767;
byte b = 10b;
byte b = 127;
short s = 32767s;
short s = 32768;
short s = 10S;

13. Valid or not?
a)  double d = _1_23456.78_9;
b)  double d = 1_23456_.78_9;
c)  double d = 1_234__56.78_9_;

14. Is this legal?  float f = 10L;
    If so, how can an 8 byte long be assigned to a 4 byte float?
15. Can short(2 bytes) be assigned to a float(2 bytes), or vice-versa?
    Why/why not?

ANSWERS: ------------------------------------------------------


1. source code representation of primitive data types
'b', 42, false, 2546789.343
Any constant value that can be assigned to a variable.
int x = 10  |  dataType  identifier =  literal(decimal form, here)

2. decimal(base 10), octal(base 8), 
hexadecimal(base 16), (Java 7)binary(base 2)

3. underscores

4. beginning or end
next to a decimal pt.
next to an X
next to a B

4.5 True

5. 0B or 0b - int b1 = 0B01010;

6. 0 t0 7. By placing a zero in front of the number.
class Octal {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int six=06;  //equals decimal 6
		int seven=07 //equals decimal 7
		int eight=010 //equals decimal 8
		int nine=011  //equals decimal 9
		System.out.println("Octal 010 = " + eight);
	}
}
Up to 21 digits, not including the leading 0.

7. 16 digits, not including prefix 0X/0x or optional suffix extension L.
 0-f. There no single-digit symbols for 10-15.
class HexTest {
	psvm(String[] args) {
		int x = 0X0001;
		int 7 = 0x7fffffff;
		int z = 0xDeadCafe;
		System.out.println("x = " + x + "y = " + y + " z = " + z);
	}
}

8. int. long. A suffix of L or l after the number.
long jo = 110599L;
long so = 0xFFFl;

9. invalid, valid, valid valid, invalid, valid

10. 10, 8, 16.    Decimal form.

11. valid, invalid(CE: PLP found long, required int), valid (int into long)

12. No. If in the range, they will be converted implicitly.
invalid, valid, invalid, valid, invalid, invalid, invalid

13. All invalid

*  byte ---> short ----\
    1b	      2b
			int --> long --> float --> double
			4b	    8b	   4b          8b
	   char ------/
	    2b
			integral            floating-point
				
8 byte long value can be assigned to 4 byte float variable because
both are following different memory representations internally.
float f = 10L;  ---->   f = 10.0     (valid)

char/short both 2 bytes, but can't be assigned to each other.
char is an unsigned data type, short is signed.
16 bits represent the value  ,    only 15 bits represent the value
char cannot hold a negative value.
